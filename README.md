# Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

This case study was my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. 
I had a hard time deciding if I would use spreadsheets, BigQuery or R Studio to complete this project. 
This is the first solo project that I worked on and it was definetely a learning process. 

## Learning Curves
While completing this project I came across a few things I felt I should focus on in order to become a better data analyst.
I need to study SQL and R Functions beyond the basics that I currently know, visualizations on Tableau and Pivot Tables in spreadsheets like Google Sheets and Excel. 

I plan to use this case study as a reference point for my future projects and remind myself of where I need to improve. 
I hope to revisit this project and continually improve it overtime.
